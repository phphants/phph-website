# Setup
[![Symfony](https://github.com/phphants/phph-website/actions/workflows/symfony.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phphants/phph-website/actions/workflows/symfony.yml)

Easiest way to work with this project is to install the [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) tool.

Once installed you can clone this repository, run `composer install` & `symfony serve` and the site should be running
at https://127.0.0.1:8000

## Changing styles

PHP Hampshire's website uses [Tailwind](https://symfony.com/bundles/TailwindBundle/current/index.html) for its style
management. You can find the Tailwind documentation at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
