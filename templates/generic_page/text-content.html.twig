            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetings are required to agree with the following
                code of
                conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout all events. We are expecting cooperation from all
                participants to help ensure a safe, inclusive environment for everybody.
            </p>

            <p>tl;dr: We operate a zero-tolerance policy on harassment. Keep it friendly.</p>

            <p>Additionally, we expect you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Behave professionally.</li>
                <li>Be respectful to others.</li>
                <li>Not insult or put down others&#39; experience or ability.
                </li>
                <li>Share and be nice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Need Help?</h2>
            <p>You can contact the organisers at info@phphants.co.uk or speak to an organiser, in person, at an event.
            </p>

            <p>The list of current organisers and how to contact them is available on the <a
                        href="http://www.phphants.co.uk/team">team
                    page</a>.</p>

            <p>If you have a complaint that involves an organiser, you can contact one of the other organisers in
                confidence.
                The group is the priority and steps will be taken to ensure the group is successful.
            </p>

            <p>PHP Hants is part of a larger community of PHP User Groups, around the world. If you feel your complaint
                requires
                external arbitration, let one of the organisers know and we can discuss the issue with the organisers of
                those
                User Groups.
            </p>
            <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Our user group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of skills,
                background, experience, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                race,
                or
                religion (or lack thereof).
            </p>

            <p>We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
                appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, social events or online channels.
                Community
                members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the
                organisers.
            </p>
            <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability,
                physical
                appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
                stalking,
                following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                inappropriate
                physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
            </p>

            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>

            <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
                sexualised
                images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
                clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
            </p>
            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem
                appropriate,
                including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund.
            </p>
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
                contact
                an organiser immediately.
            </p>

            <p>We expect community participants to follow these rules at all times, including at meetups, conferences,
                workshops, via our online communities and any related socials.
            </p>
